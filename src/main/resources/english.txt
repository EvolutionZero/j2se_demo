The PRSS-1 is China's first optical remote sensing satellite sold to Pakistan and the 17th satellite developed by the China Academy of Space Technology (CAST) for an overseas buyer.

A scientific experiment satellite, PakTES-1A, developed by Pakistan, was sent into orbit via the same rocket.

After entering orbit, the PRSS-1 is in good condition with its solar panels unfolded smoothly1, according to CAST.

The PRSS-1 will be used for land and resources surveying, monitoring of natural disasters, agriculture research, urban construction and providing remote sensing information for the Belt and Road region.

The satellite, which has a designed life of seven years, is equipped with two panchromatic/multispectral cameras, with a resolution up to a meter and a coverage2 range of 60 km.

Designers say the two cameras are among the best exported remote sensing cameras made by China. They can be used to monitor plant diseases and pests.

Each camera has independent image processing, storage and transmission capability3. The design of lossless compression could greatly improve the quality of the images, according to designers.

A specially4 designed orbit will ensure the satellite operates steadily5 and will optimize6 the image quality.
